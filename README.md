# CRASH
###CRASH### Complete Model
This is a complete model for the CRASH scenario based on the documentation and provided code. 
**Note:** I have tried to change as little as possible but some things had to be changed. I tried to use as many OOP design principles as possible however I didn't want to change every little detial.

Some of the weird design decisions weren't changed to keep it as close to the original as possible. Do not tell me it looks ugly, I know.

# File I/O
###Resources###
This is where the printers text is stored.
###Saves###
This is where the serialised objects are saved.
###File Loader###
I use my custom semi-colon separated file format copied from our SpaceWars coursework. How to use it should be self explanatory.

# Usage
Clone and run.

# Creds
Do whatever you want with it, for education purposes only ofc :^)
